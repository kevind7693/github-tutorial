## Git vs. GitHub
__Git__: Is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of your code and edits. Git is on local(doesn't need internet unless if done on an ide). **Can work without github.**   

  
__Github__: Is a cloud based service that allows you to "push" your git repositories onto it. It also allows collaboration between 2 or more users on a single project. **Relies on git.**
